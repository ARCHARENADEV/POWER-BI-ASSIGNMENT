# POWER-BI-ASSIGNMENT
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global store data, featuring a range of visuals that offer insights into sales, profit, and market distribution. A line graph displays city-based sales and profit breakdown, while a global map illustrates sales by country. An area chart shows the distribution of market share across categories, and cards display total profit and total sales. A donut chart reveals sales distribution by country, and a pie chart indicates total shipping cost by ship mode. Additional visuals include a clustered bar chart for regional sales overview, a stacked bar chart for sales by category and market, and a scatter chart examining sales and profit by quantity. A line chart displays monthly sales trends, and a matrix provides customer and product sales and profit insights. Further analysis is offered through a treemap showing profit distribution across subcategories, and a chart breaking down ticket sales by ship mode and region.
